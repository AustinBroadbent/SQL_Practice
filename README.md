# SQL Practice
Practice writing SQL queries using Google BigQuery and publicly available datasets.

For these exercises, I used the CFPB complaints table uploaded to BigQuery as a public dataset. 
The table schema is below:

## Beginner (1â€“5): SELECTs, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY

<details>
<summary>1. List the first 10 complaints with their complaint_id, product, and date_received.</summary>

```sql
SELECT complaint_id, product, date_received
FROM bigquery-public-data.cfpb_complaints.complaint_database
LIMIT 10
```

![alt text](https://github.com/AustinBroadbent/SQL_Practice/blob/main/images/first_10_complaints.png "First 10 complaints in the table")
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Find all complaints related to the product "Credit card".</summary>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.cfpb_complaints.complaint_database
WHERE product = "Credit card"
```
